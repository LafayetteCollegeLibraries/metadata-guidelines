# Rights Statement

| Condition  | Value |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Definition  |    Rights statements express the copyright status of a Digital Object, as well as information about how you can access and re-use the objects. |
| Required?   | **Yes**                      |
| Repeatable? | Yes                        |

## Guidelines

- Rights information may be found in the item itself, in the digital project documentation, or in accompanying or supplemental information.

- The most common right statements in the LDR are the **Public Domain Mark (PDM), In Copyright,** and **Copyright Undetermined**.

- For Faculty publications, where the copyright status of a resource is undetermined, always apply the <u>[In Copyright (InC)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/)</u> rights statement.

- All Creative Commons licenses can only be applied by, or with the permission of, the rights holder. The rights holder may be the author, co-authors, publisher, or other person or entities related to the item.

The following Right Statements are available in the LDR:

| Rights Statement Label      | Description* |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <u>[Public Domain Mark (PDM)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/)</u>      | The Public Domain Mark (PDM) is applied to Digital Objects which are no longer protected by copyright. Objects that are labelled as being in the public domain can be used by anyone without any restrictions.       |
| <u>[No copyright – non-commercial re-use only (NoC-NC)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-NC/1.0/)   | The NoC-NC statement is applied to public domain Digital Objects which have been digitized as an outcome of a public-private partnership, where the terms of the contractual agreement limit commercial use for a certain period of time.        |
| <u>[No copyright – other known legal restriction (NoC-OKLR)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-OKLR/1.0/)</u>   | The NoC-OKLR statement is for use with public domain Digital Objects that are subject to known legal restrictions other than copyright which prevent their free re-use. Data providers must provide a link to a page detailing the legal restrictions that limit re-use of the object.        |
| <u>[Creative Commons CC- 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)</u>   | CC0 is used to waive all the rights in a Digital Object. By applying this waiver, all possible existing rights in the content are waived, and the objects can be used by anyone without any restrictions.        |
| <u>[Creative Commons – Attribution (BY)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</u>   | The CC BY license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon the licensed work, even commercially, as long as they attribute the rights holder as described in the license. CC BY is recommended to enable access, discovery and use of licensed works.       |
| <u>[Creative Commons – Attribution, ShareAlike (BY-SA)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)</u>   | The CC BY-SA license lets others remix, tweak and build upon the licensed work, even for commercial purposes, as long as they attribute the rights holder as described in the license, and license their adaptions of the work under the same terms. All new works based on the original licensed work will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.        |
| <u>[Creative Commons – Attribution, No Derivatives (BY-ND)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)</u>   | The CC BY-ND license allows for redistribution, including commercial and non-commercial use of the work as long as no alteration is made to the work and the rights holder is attributed according to the specifications of the license.        |
| <u>[Creative Commons – Attribution, Non-Commercial (BY-NC)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)</u>   | The CC BY-NC license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon the licensed work for non-commercial use. Any new works created and based on your work must be attributed to the rights holder as specified in the license, and may be available for non-commercial use only. |
| <u>[Creative Commons – Attribution, Non-Commercial, ShareAlike (BY-NC-SA)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)</u>   | The CC BY-NC-SA license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon the licensed work for non-commercial use as long as they attribute the rights holder of the work under the terms specified in the license, and license new creations under identical terms.        |
| <u>[Creative Commons – Attribution, Non-Commercial, No Derivatives (BY-NC-ND)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)</u>  | The CC BY-NC-ND license is the most restrictive of the six Creative Commons licenses, only allowing others to download the licensed works and share them with others as long as they attribute the rights holder as specified in the license, but users cannot change the work in any way or use them commercially.        |
| <u>[In Copyright (InC)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/)</u>   |  The InC statement is for use with in copyright Digital Objects which are freely available online and where re-use requires additional permission from the rights holder(s). This rights statement should be used for objects where any re-use is subject to additional permission from the rights holder(s), or you do not want or are not authorized to allow re-use of the Digital Object. For Faculty publications, where the copyright status of a resource is undetermined, always apply the <u>[In Copyright (InC)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/)</u> rights statement.        |
| <u>[In Copyright – Educational Use Permitted (InC-EDU)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/)</u>   | The InC-EDU statement is for use with in copyright Digital Objects which are freely available online and where the rights holder(s) have allowed re-use for educational purposes only.       |
| <u>[In copyright – EU Orphan Work (InC-EU-OW)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-OW-EU/1.0/)</u>   | The InC-EU-OW statement is for use with Digital Objects that have been identified as an Orphan Work in the country of first publication and in line with the requirements of the national law implementing Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works.        |
| <u>[In copyright - non-commercial use permitted (InC – NC)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-NC/1.0/)</u>   | The InC-NC statement is for use with in copyright Digital Objects, which are freely available online and where the rights holder(s) have allowed reuse for non-commercial purposes only. For other uses you must obtain permission from the rights holder(s).        |
| <u>[In copyright - rights-holder(s) unlocatable or unidentifiable (InC-RUU)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-RUU/1.0/)</u>   | This item is protected by copyright and/or other rights, but either no rights specific rights holder has been identified or the rights holder cannot be located.        |
| <u>[No copyright - contractual restrictions (NoC-CR)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-CR/1.0/)</u>   | Even though this item is free from copyright and/or related rights, limits have been placed on its use as part of the acquisition or digitization of the Work. Limitations may include, but are not limited to, privacy issues, cultural protections, digitization agreements or donor agreements.        |
| <u>[No copyright - United States (NoC-US)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/)</u>   | The copyright status of the item has been evaluated and we believe it is in the Public Domain in the USA, but have not determined if it is in the Public Domain according to law of other countries.        |
| <u>[Copyright Not Evaluated (CNE)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/CNE/1.0/)</u>   | The CNE statement is for use with Digital Objects where the copyright status has not been evaluated.        |
| <u>[Copyright Undetermined (UND)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/)</u>   | The copyright status of the item has been reviewed, but we were unable to conclusively determine the status. The user may need to obtain other permission depending on their intended use of the item. For Faculty publications, where the copyright status of a resource is undetermined, always apply the <u>[In Copyright (InC)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/)</u> rights statement.        |
| <u>[No Known Copyright (NKC)](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NKC/1.0/)</u>   | The copyright status of the item has been reviewed, and although we reasonably believe that the item isn’t restricted by copyright or other related (*e.g.* Moral) rights, this couldn’t be determined conclusively. The user may need to obtain other permission depending on their intended use of the item.        |
