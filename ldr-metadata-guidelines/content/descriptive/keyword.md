# Keyword

| Condition  | Value |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Definition  |  Words or tags used to describe what the content is about. Keywords use natural language; they do not conform to any controlled vocabulary or subject heading classification. |
| Required?   | No                        |
| Repeatable? | Yes                        |

## Guidelines

In many cases, the item must be read or examined in order to determine appropriate keyword(s). Keywords serve two main functions: helping users locate the resource being described, and grouping similar resources in relevant search results.

- Use lowercase, unless the keywords are proper nouns

- Use plural forms of keywords, unless there isnâ€™t a logical plural form

- Keep keywords or phrases short \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; remove unnecessary articles \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; economize word order to make phrases as concise as possible

- Use publisher- and/or author-supplied keywords when available for faculty content
