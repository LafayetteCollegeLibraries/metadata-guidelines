## Guidelines

Take the Citation directly from the source if possible. For example, many Citations for academic journal articles are supplied by the publisher on a title page, in a page header or footer, or in accompanying or supplemental information.

- Enter the Citation exactly as it appears in the source.

- If no Citation is supplied by the publisher, use the following format: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Author LastName, Author FirstName. Publication Date, “Title.” Publication
Title, Volume: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue, Page Range.**

-  For values expressed by numbers (for example pages, volume, issue), include only digits and not text. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Correct:** 10: 4, 135-140 \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Not correct:** Vol. 10: Issue 4, pages 135-140
