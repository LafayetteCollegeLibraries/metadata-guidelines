&rarr; for example, the [Library of Congress Name Authority File](https://authorities.loc.gov/) \

- When entering a personal name: \
&rarr; use the name format **Last, First Middle** \
&rarr; include multiple parts (*e.g.* von, de la) as part of the last name \
&rarr; include all parts of a hyphenated name as the last name
