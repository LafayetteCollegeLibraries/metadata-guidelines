# Description

| Condition  | Value |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Definition  |  An account of the resource content. |
| Required?   | No                        |
| Repeatable? | Yes                        |

## Guidelines

In most cases, the item will have to be read or examined in order to determine a description of the content. The Description should contain details about the people, places, events, or themes depicted in or discussed by the resource.

Some best practices for writing item descriptions include:

- Form complete sentences with proper grammar, ending with a period.

- Take the Description directly from the source when possible.

- For serials (such as items in the newspaper, magazine, and student publication collections), a generic description of the content in the series can be used in each item metadata record.

| Example:      |
| ----------- |
| A digital archive of the Lafayette College student newspaper (Easton, Pennsylvania).      |
