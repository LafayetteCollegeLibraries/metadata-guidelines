## Guidelines

Ancillary title information for the resource. A main title is required before subtitle(s) may be used. For example, Mary Shelley uses the alternative title 'The Modern Prometheus' to hint at the theme of her most famous novel 'Frankenstein'; Nick Efford uses the subtitle 'a practical introduction using Java' to qualify the title of his book 'Digital Image Processing'.
