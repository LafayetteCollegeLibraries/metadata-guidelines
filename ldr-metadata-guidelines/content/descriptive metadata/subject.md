## Guidelines

In most cases, the item must be read or examined in order to determine subject(s) terms.

- In the repository Work dashboard, the Subject property is configured to fetch controlled subject headings from OCLC FAST. \
&rarr; <u>[FAST](http://fast.oclc.org/searchfast/)</u> (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology) is derived from the Library of Congress Subject Headings, and includes more than 1.7 million authority records that have been optimized for use with Web resources. \
&rarr; Enter the value of the subject, then select from returned results if they match

&rarr; If no relevant controlled subject term is returned from FAST, consider adding the value as a keyword instead \
&rarr; Once selected by the user, FAST headings are stored as URIs in order to facilitate interoperability with linked data
