## Guidelines

- Spatial coverage is about the <u>content</u> of item and refers to a geographic location, and not to proper place names such as buildings or human-created landmarks.

- In the repository Work dashboard, this property is configured to fetch controlled geographic location data from the <u>[GeoNames webservice](http://www.geonames.org/)</u>. \
&rarr; Enter the geographic location into the form, then select from the list retrieved from GeoNames. This populates the value with a URI for the location, which serves as linked geographic data.

- As an alternative to GeoNames, the LDR also supports Getty Thesaurus of <u>[Geographic Names linked data service](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/)</u>. \
&rarr; TGN is recommended as a controlled vocabulary source if the item or collection deals primarily with historical location information, for example political or geographic names that are no longer in existence.

- Proper names for buildings, neighborhoods, geographic regions, or other non- controlled location information can be entered in the Keyword property.
