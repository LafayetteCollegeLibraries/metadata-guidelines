## Guidelines

Creators include any entity that was centrally involved in creating the item.

- Only include entities that are <u>primarily responsible</u> for the creation of the item. \
&rarr; “secondary creators” (entities related to the item but not directly related to its creation) should be entered in the Contributor property instead.

- Enter information for all known Creators, with names separated by a pipe character | and no spaces.

- When possible, consult an authority file to locate the controlled form of the name \
&rarr; for example, the <u>[Library of Congress Name Authority File](https://authorities.loc.gov/)</u> \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Getty Research Institute <u>[Union List of Artist Names](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/)</u>

- If no creator information is known or readily available, leave the property empty.

- When entering a personal name: \
&rarr; use the name format **Last, First Middle** \
&rarr; include multiple parts (*e.g.* von, de la) as part of the last name \
&rarr; include all parts of a hyphenated name as the last name
