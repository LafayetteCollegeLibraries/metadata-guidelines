## Guidelines

In most cases, the Editor name(s) can be found in the title page, colophon, or any other information source that also includes Creator name(s).

- When possible, consult an authority file to locate the controlled form of the name \
&rarr; for example, the <u>[Library of Congress Name Authority File](https://authorities.loc.gov/)</u> \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Getty Research Institute <u>[Union List of Artist Names](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/)</u>

- When entering a personal name: \
&rarr; use the name format **Last, First Middle** \
&rarr; include multiple parts (*e.g.* von, de la) as part of the last name \
&rarr; include all parts of a hyphenated name as the last name
