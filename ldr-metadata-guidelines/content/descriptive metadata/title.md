## Guidelines

Every work in the LDR must have one value in the Title property.

- If the work has a formal Title, transcribe it as it appears in the original - including capitalization and punctuation.

- If no formal or official Title exist, devise a brief descriptive title. Enclose this supplied or devised title in square brackets [] \
&rarr; A good descriptive title uniquely and specifically describes the resource \
&rarr; To come up with a descriptive title for a resource, consider identifying people in an image by first and last name, names/owners/addresses of buildings or locations, and the type or perspective of the resource \
&rarr; **Examples** of devised descriptive titles: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Delta Tau Delta Fraternity House] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Panoramic View of the Imperial Palace, Kyoto] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[McKelvy House: Gardens]

<br />

### For items in the Newspaper collection use the following formula:
- The Lafayette, Month Day, Year
  - **Example:** The Lafayette, November 15, 2019

<br />

- Use the Alternative Title property for other forms of the title (*e.g.* for versions of the title in languages other than English).

- Language-tagged Field
  - Use the box to the right of the property in the Work dashboard to enter the language of the Title value
  - Select the language from the generated list. The language value will be stored as an ISO 639-1 (two letter) code.
